	Longest subsequence: {1,40,3,8,12} = {1,3,8,12} = |4|

	-via recursion = O(2^n) = ew

	-we use dynamic programming when our usual methods yeild unacceptable results

	-Basically you can find it by saying i is the last element and checking the max until i-1 (which is j). This only works as long j is less than i and the actual value of i and j inside the array is less as well. Continue recursing and you'll end up with the max length of the longest subsequence. 

	-0(n^2) because of two for loops (pretty cool method of counting)
