	-base case:
		-zero elemnts in the array - false :(
		-integer equals zero - true

	-other:
		-check the elements of the array, zero is always true
		-and subtract the integer from the value of the array and see if it's bigger than or less
			-if it's less than, take the value that's already there
			-if it's not, then or it with the zeroth value, which becomes the new index value
