Report (70%). 
In your report, include descriptions for both algorithms. Prove that your algorithms are correct, and provide running time analysis. Algorithms should be explained in plain english. You can use pseudocodes if it helps your explanation, but the grader will not try to understand a complicated pseudocode.

Nlogn

Time complexity of mergesort: Θ(n log(n))

Citation: https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs374/homework/hw4.pdf

Description:


General Protocol:
	-compare i and j
	-if i is less than j, and the the indexed value of i is greater than j in the vector Q, then the line segments will intersect
	-if there are less than 100 numbers, brute force is used, so the logarithmic time is constant (O(1)). 


-Split Q into two and sort it and count inversions as you go




Running time analysis:

still runs in O(n) time,
 T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)
So it’s still O(n log n)
